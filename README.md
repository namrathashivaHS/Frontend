The Project is School Management System.

In this Project we have four user sets Admin,Teacher,Student and Parents.

The Admin has universal access and can add, delete and modify Students, Staffs, Parents and Timetable.

The Teacher can mark Attendance and prepare Progress report and can modify the same on need basis.

The Student can view his/her Attendance and Progress Report.

The Parents can also view their children Attendance and Progress Report.

Each category of user has a separate login and profile.

Their is only One Admin and only admin has rights to create any other category of user the other users can view only About page only without getting an account created.

When Admin add any user (Student,Teacher and Parents) their password is automatically generated and once the user logged in they can change it with forgot password option.

password created for the users based on this logic:-

Student:-starting 4 characters from the email in that first character is uppercase and rest 3 characters are in lowercase and then '@' character class of that student twice for example if the email is smitha@gmail.com and this student studing in 10th then the password is Smit@1010.

Teacher:- starting 4 characters from the email in that first character is uppercase and rest 3 characters are in lowercase and then '@' character and then the first 4 characters of the mobile number for example if the teacher email id is mamatha@gmail.com then mobile number is 1234567890 then the password is Mama@1234

Parents:- the password criteria for parents is same as the teachers first 4 email characters 1st cahracter is uppercase then '@' the first four characters from the mobile number.
